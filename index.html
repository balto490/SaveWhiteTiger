	  		<p>Poaching is one of the most immediate threats to wild tigers. Every part of the tiger—from whisker to tail—is sold on the illegal black market for wildlife as traditional medicine, folk remedies and status symbols.</p>
	  		<br>
	  		<p>Since 1900, the number of tigers in the wild has shrunk from an estimated 100,000 to as few as 3,200. WWF is working toward a bold but achievable goal to double the number of tigers in the wild by 2022, the next Year of the Tiger.</p>

	  		<p>Crowds love black-and-white animals. Perhaps the sharp contrast of light and dark conjures long-lost memories of how the world looks to people in their first weeks of life. Whatever the explanation, we’re often transfixed by the sight of zebras, orcas, giant pandas—and especially by the presence of white tigers. Just ask the Las Vegas entertainers Siegfried and Roy.</p>
	  		<p>Sometimes the attraction turns fatal, as it did a couple of weeks ago for a young man who toppled into a Delhi zoo’s tiger enclosure. But long before that deadly incident animal welfare advocates began disputing the wisdom of raising white tigers. More than 30 years ago William Conway, director of the then New York Zoological Society (now known as the Wildlife Conservation Society), became convinced that the rare cats were merely the victims of a hereditary defect that was propagated because the animals were kept and deliberately bred as glorified sideshow exhibits. “White tigers are freaks,” he declared more than 30 years ago. “It’s not the role of a zoo to show two-headed calves and white tigers.” Three years ago the Association of Zoos and Aquariums endorsed that opinion, instructing all AZA members to cease any breeding of captive white tigers.</p>
	  		<p>The truth is that white tigers are the product of a rare but naturally occurring genetic variant within the wild Bengal population. Even so, the experts’ confusion about the subject has been understandable, given the previous lack of precise information on the white tiger’s genetic roots. It was only last year that our team published the work cracking the mystery at last.</p>
